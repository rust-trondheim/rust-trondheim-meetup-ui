# Rust Trondheim Meetup UI

A not very serious Rust application for showing information about Rust Trondheim Meetups that's using [Slint](https://slint.rs) for the UI.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
1. Build with cargo
   ```
   cargo build
   ```
1. Run the application binary
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

We recommend using an IDE for development, along with our [LSP-based IDE integration for `.slint` files](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/tools/lsp/README.md). You can also load this project directly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install our [Slint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint).
